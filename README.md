The Simon game is a memory-based pattern-matching game where the user needs to repeat the pattern generated by the computer. 
The game combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript/jQuery for dynamic behavior, event handling, and game logic. Additionally, audio files are used to enhance the gaming experience with sound effects.
